 <h2><center> Control and Coordination </center></h2> 
<h2><center> SUMMARY </center></h2>

<ol type="A">
<li><h2>Movement in organisms</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>The ability of organisms to move certain body parts is movement.</li>
<li>When they move from one place to another, it is called locomotion.</li>
<li>Organisms show movements in response to stimuli.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Introduction to control & coordination</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>Organisms move in response to various kinds of stimuli like light, heat, nutrients/food, mate etc.</li>
<li>All the activities in animals are controlled and coordinated by the nervous and endocrine system.</li>
<li>Hormones are chemical messengers which assist the nervous system in carrying out various functions. They are secreted 
by endocrine glands.</li>
<li>Hormones in plants coordinate the movements.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</h2></li>
<ol type="a">
<li><h3>Neuron</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>Neuron is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system.</li>
<li>Each neuron has three main parts: dendrites, cyton/soma/cell body and axon.</li>
<li>Dendrites receive impulses from other neurons.</li>
<li>Cyton/soma processes the impulse.</li>
<li>Axon transmits the impulse, either to another neuron or to muscles/glands etc.</li>
<li>Axon may be myelinated or non-myelinated.</li>
<li>The impulse transmission is faster in myelinated neurons.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Central nervous system</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of the brain and the spinal cord. </li>
<li>Cerebrum is responsible for reasoning, logic, emotions, speech, memory, visual processing, recognition of auditory 
and taste stimuli, etc.</li>
<li>Cerebellum regulates and coordinates body movements, posture and balance.</li>
<li>Pons relays signals from hindbrain to forebrain.</li>
<li>Medulla Oblongata controls all involuntary movements like vomiting, sneezing, yawning, heartbeat, breathing, blood 
pressure, etc.</li>
<li>Medulla oblongata continues as the spinal cord which runs through the vertebral column and it controls reflex actions.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Peripheral nervous system</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>The nerves given out by the brain and the spinal cord form the peripheral nervous system (PNS).</li>
<li>There are 12 cranial nerves and 31 spinal nerves in humans.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Somatic nervous system</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>It forms a part of the PNS.</li>
<li>The nerves of PNS that control the voluntary actions of the body form the somatic nervous system.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Autonomic nervous system</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>All the nerves of the PNS that control the involuntary actions in the body form the autonomic nervous system.</li>
<li>Two divisions of autonomic nervous system are: sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system</li>
<li>The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for intense physical activity and is often referred to as the fight-or-
flight response while the parasympathetic nervous system has almost the exact opposite effect and relaxes the body and 
inhibits or slows many high energy functions.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<li><h2>Reflex action</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>Reflex action is a sudden, involuntary reaction of the body in response to stimuli.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Reflex arc</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>It is the path followed by electrical impulse during a reflex action.</li>
<li>The impulse travels from the receptor organ to the spinal cord/brain; is processed there and the information is brought back 
to the concerned muscle to carry out the action.</li>
<li>Thus, receptor organ, sensory/afferent neuron, interneuron, motor/efferent neuron and effector organ are the components 
of a reflex arc.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>The Endocrine System</h2></li>
<ol type="a">
<li><h3>Exocrine glands </h3></li>
<ol>
<li>Exocrine glands are glands that discharge secretions by means of  ducts, which open onto an epithelial surface.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Endocrine glands</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>Endocrine glands are the ductless glands which secrete hormones into the bloodstream in humans.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Pituitary gland</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>It is a pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain.</li>
<li>It is the master gland as it controls the secretions of all the other endocrine glands.</li>
<li>It also secretes Growth Hormone (GH). Under-secretion of GH causes ‘Dwarfism’ and over-secretion causes ‘Gigantism’ in 
children and ‘Acromegaly’ in adults.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Thyroid gland</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>It is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the throat.</li>
<li>It secretes the hormone ‘Thyroxine’ which regulates the metabolism of the body.</li>
<li>Iodine is required to synthesize thyroxine in the body.</li>
<li>In case of iodine deficiency, under-secretion of thyroxine leads to goitre.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Pancreas</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>It is a leaf-like gland present behind the stomach in the abdomen.</li>
<li>It is an endocrine as well an exocrine gland.</li>
<li>As an endocrine gland, it manufactures two hormones – Insulin and glucagon.</li>
<li> Both these hormones act antagonistically and regulate the sugar level in the blood.</li>
<li>As an exocrine gland, it secretes enzymes to break down the proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids in food.</li>
<li>Insufficient amount of insulin from pancreas leads to diabetes.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Adrenal gland</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>Occurs in pair above each kidney.</li>
<li>It decreases in size with age.</li>
<li>Secrets the hormone adrenaline which helps in flight and fight response.</li>
<li>Also secretes nor adrenaline</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Gonads</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>Gonads are the gamete-producing organs – testes in males and ovaries in females.</li>
<li>The testes produce the male hormone testosterone and ovaries produce the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone.</li>
<li>Testosterone and oestrogen help in producing gametes and are responsible for the sexual characteristics in males and 
females respectively.</li>
<li>Progesterone is the pregnancy hormone.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<li><h2>Other endocrine organs</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>The other endocrine organs include the hypothalamus, parathyroid, pineal and thymus glands.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
