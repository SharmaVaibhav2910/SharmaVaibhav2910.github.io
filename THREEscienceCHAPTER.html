<h1> SCIENCE </h1>

 <h2><center> Heredity and Evolution </center></h2> 
<h2><center> SUMMARY </center></h2>

<ol type="A">
<li><h2>Sexual reproduction </h2></li>
<ol>
<li>The mode of reproduction that involves two individuals; one male and one female.</li>
<li>They produce sex cells or gametes which fuse to form a new organism.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Genes </h2></li>
<ol>
<li>Gene is the functional unit of heredity.</li>
<li>Every gene controls one or several particular characteristic features in living organisms.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Heredity </h2></li>
<ol>
<li>The process by which the features of an organism is passed on from one generation to another is called heredity.</li>
<li>The tall trait of the plant is said to be dominant over the short trait.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Recessive traits </h2></li>
<ol>
<li>A trait which is not expressed in presence of a dominant allele is known as recessive.</li>
<li>So, recessive character/trait is present in an organism but cannot be seen if a dominant allele exists.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Monohybrid cross </h2></li>
<ol>
<li>When only one character is considered while crossing two organisms, then such a cross is known as monohybrid cross.</li>
<li>The ratio of characters, arising out of this cross, at F2 generation is called monohybrid ratio.</li>
<li>E.g., If tall plant (TT) is crossed with a dwarf plant (tt), we get 3 tall:1 short plant at the end of the F2 generation.</li>
<li>So, 3:1 is monohybrid ratio.</li>
<li>Here, the height of the plant is considered at a time.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Dihybrid cross </h2></li>
<ol>
<li>When two characters are considered while crossing two organisms, then such a cross is known as a dihybrid cross.</li>
<li>The ratio of characters, arising out of this cross, at F2 generation is called dihybrid ratio.</li>
<li>E.g., If a plant with round and green pea is crossed with a plant with wrinkled and yellow pea,</li>
<li>The first generation plants would all have round and green pea.</li>
<li>On crossing the same for an F2 generation, we would observe four combinations of characters in the ratio of 9:3:3:1.</li>
<li>Thus, 9:3:3:1 is the dihybrid ratio.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Inheritance </h2></li>
<ol>
<li>In Biology, inheritance pertains to the transfer of traits from one generation to another.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Sex determination </h2></li>
<ol>
<li>The process of determining the sex of an individual based on the composition of the genetic material is called sex 
determination.</li>
<li>In different animals, sex of an embryo is determined by different factors.</li>
<li>In humans, sex determination happens on the basis of the presence or absence of Y chromosome.</li>
<li>XX is female and XY is male</li>
<li>An ovum always contains X chromosome.</li>
<li>An Ovum, upon fusion with Y containing sperm, gives rise to a male child and upon fusion with X containing sperm 
gives rise to a girl child.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Traits </h2></li>
<ol>
<li>Traits are characteristic features of an organism, manifested in a physical form that is visible or in a physiological 
aspect of the organism.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Acquired characters </h2></li>
<ol>
<li>The traits that are acquired by an organism over the period of its lifetime are termed as acquired characters.</li>
<li>These characters may or may not get transferred to the next generation.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Inherited characters</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>The traits that are inherited from the parents are called inherited characters.</li>
<li>These traits always get transferred to the next generation, but depending on the dominance or recessiveness it may or 
may not be expressed.</li>
<li>Examples are height, skin colour, and eye colour.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Variation </h2></li> 
<ol type="a">
<li><h3>Genetic variations </h3></li>
<ol>
<li>The differences in the DNA sequences among every organism leading to the diverse gene pool are called genetic variations. </li>
<li>These differences lead to different/varied physical characters or biochemical pathways.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Natural selection</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>It is the phenomenon by which a favourable trait in a population of a species is selected.</li>
<li>Changing natural conditions exert equal pressure on all the existing species.</li>
<li>The species/organisms which are better adapted to the changing conditions survive and reproduce i.e. selected by nature 
and species/organisms which cannot adapt perish i.e. rejected by nature.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<li><h2>Speciation </h2></li> 
<ol type="a">
<li><h3>Genetic drift</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>Natural selection can play an important role in deciding the traits that survive in a population.</li>
<li> However, random fluctuations in gene variants are seen on many occasions. This phenomenon is known as genetic drift. </li>
<li>Thus, genetic drift is a change in the frequency of an existing allele in a small population.</li>
<li>Genetic drift may cause a gene variant to disappear from the population and thus reduce genetic variation.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Speciation</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>It is the process of formation of a new species from existing ones due to several evolutionary forces like genetic drift, 
isolation of populations, natural selection etc. </li> 
<li>Speciation leads to diversity in the ecosystem and the diversity and diversity lead to evolution.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Gene flow</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>Gene flow is the transfer of genes from one population to the next.</li>
</ol>

<li><h3>Population</h3></li>
<ol>
<li>A population is a community or a group of animals, plants or any living organism that can reproduce with each other 
and have fertile, viable offsprings.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<li><h2>What Happen to Body after the Death </h2></li>
<ol>
<li>Organisms die and they get buried in mud and silt.</li>
<li>The soft tissues of the body get quickly leaving behind the hard bones or shells</li>
<li>Over time sediments build over it and harden into rock</li>
<li>As the bones decay, mineral seep in to replace the contents cell by cell, process called as petrification</li>
<li>If bones decay completely, it leaves behind the cast of the animal.</li>
</ol>
