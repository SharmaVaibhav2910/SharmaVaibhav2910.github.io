<h2><center> SUMMARY </center></h2>

<ol type="A">
<li><h2> Lifr Process </h2></li>
<ol >
<li>The processes which together perform The maintenance functions of living organisms are life processes.</li>
<li>Movement is one of the important criteria we use to decide whether something is alive.</li>
<li>For life processes living organism’s need energy . Energy is taken inside body in the form of food.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2> Nutrition</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>The general requirement for energy and materials is common in all organisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways.</li>
<li>Some organisms use simple food material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon dioxide and water. </li>
<li>These organisms, the autotrophs, include green plants and some bacteria.</li>
<li>Other organisms utilise complex substances. These complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones 
before they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body.</li>
<li>To achieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the heterotrophs survival depends directly or 
indirectly on autotrophs.</li>
<li>Heterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2> Autotrophic Nutrition</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>Autotrophs are those organism’s which makes their own food . Like ,green plants.</li>
<li>Green Plants makes their own food by the process called photosynthesis.</li>
<li><b>Photosynthesis :-</b> It is the process by which autotrophs makes their own food with the help of carbon dioxide 
and water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll.</li>
<li>carbon dioxide and water are converted into carbohydrates</li>
<li>Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.</li>
<li>The carbohydrates which are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which serves as the internal energy 
reserve to be used as and when required by the plant.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>The following events occurs during Photosynthesis–</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>Absorption of light energy by chlorophyll.</li>
<li>Conversion of light energy to chemical energy and splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.</li>
<li>Reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates.</li>
<li><b>Chloroplast:</b> Leaf cells contain green dots. These green dots are cell organelles called chloroplasts which 
contain chlorophyll.</li>
<li><b>Stomata :</b> are tiny pores present on the surface of the leaves.</li>
<li>Massive amounts of gaseous exchange takes place in the leaves through these stmata pores for the purpose of 
photosynthesis.</li>
<li>But it is important to note here that exchange of gases occurs across the surface of stems, roots and leaves as well.</li>
<li>The plant closes these pores when it does not need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.</li>
<li><b>Guard cells:-</b> The opening and closing of the pore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when 
water flows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open. Similarly the pore closes if the guard cells shrink.</li>
<li>Autotrophs also need other raw materials for building their body.</li>
<li>Water used in photosynthesis is taken up from the soil by the roots in terrestrial plants.</li>
<li>Other materials like nitrogen, phosphorus, iron and magnesium are taken up from the soil.</li>
<li>Nitrogen is an essential element used in the synthesis of proteins and other compounds. This is taken up in the form 
of inorganic nitrates or nitrites. Or it is taken up as organic compounds which have been prepared by bacteria from 
atmospheric nitrogen.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Heterotrophic Nutrition</h2></li>
<ol>
<li><b>Heterotrophs :</b> An organism that cannot manufacture its own food and instead obtains its food and energy 
by taking in organic substances, usually plant or animal matter.</li>
<li>Each organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition differs depending on the type and availability of 
food material as well as how it is obtained by the organism.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Nutrition in Amoeba</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>Amoeba is a single-celled organism.</li>
<li>Amoeba takes in food using temporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over the food particle forming 
a food-vacuole.</li>
<li>Inside the food-vacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones which then diffuse into the cytoplasm.</li>
<li>The remaining undigested material is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out.</li>
<li>In Paramoecium, which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a definite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. 
Food is moved to this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface of the cell.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Nutrition in Human Beings</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>The alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth to the anus.</li>
<li>The digestive system is all about the digestion of food we eat.</li>
</ol>

<li><h2>Human alimentary canal</h2></li>
<ol>
<li>When we take food in mouth , the teeth breaks them into small pieces.</li> 
<li>Then,The saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that breaks down starch which is a complex molecule to 
give sugar. </li>
<li>The food is mixed thoroughly with saliva and moved around the mouth while chewing by the muscular tongue. </li>
<li>then,From the mouth, the food is taken to the stomach through the food-pipe or oesophagus. From food pipe the food enters 
our stomach .</li>
