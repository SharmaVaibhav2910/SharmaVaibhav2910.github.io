<h1> POEM</h1>
<h1><center> CHAPTER-3  </center> </h1>
 <h2><center> My Mother at 66 </center></h2> 
<h2><center> SUMMARY </center></h2>

<h2>Central Idea</h2>
<ol>
<li>Aging is an important phase of human life. A person enters his childhood, experiences youth when he is full of energy and dreams 
to have luxury of life. Finally, he approaches his old age and encounters death. Relationship between people becomes stronger at 
every aspect of life and they can’t bear separation due to aging.</li>

<li>In this poem, the poet relates a personal experience. She brings out a common paradox of human relationships and portrays a 
sensational separation of a mother and a daughter. She has been able to capture almost all the emotions which a daughter is filled 
with, on bidding farewell to her beloved mother. Sometimes we do feel deep sympathy for someone but we fail to express it in a 
proper manner.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li>One last Friday morning, the poetess was driving from her parents’ home to the Cochin airport. Her mother was sitting beside 
her in the car. She suddenly had a look at her mother. She found that her mother was dozing with her open mouth. Her face was as 
pale as that of a corpse. The poet painfully realized that her mother is not going to live long. This painful thought haunted her. 
But soon she tried to put it off by looking out of the car window. She saw the young trees running past them. She looked at the 
merry children coming out of their homes. As she saw life and vitality in the outside world, the painful thought passed away 
from her mind.</li>

<li>After reaching the airport, she went through the security check. Her mother was standing outside a few yards away. After the 
security check, she looked at her mother again. Her face was pale white like a late winter’s moon. She felt the old familiar ache 
of childhood in her heart which is usually felt by a child due to the fear of separation from his/ her mother. But she contained 
herself and kept on smiling in order to conceal her emotions. She spoke no word to her mother. All that she said was, 
“See you soon, Amma” and bade good bye to her mother with a hope to see her again.</li>
</ol>
