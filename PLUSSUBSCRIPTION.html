<b><u>VK LMS </u></b> Plus Subscription (the "Subscription Service") is a personalized Subscription that offers, recommends 
and helps you discover digital educational content created and live streamed by top educators ( "Educational Content") 
in the category of your interest. You can access the Subscription and Educational Content, through the<b><u>VK LMS </u></b>website or 
<b><u>VK LMS </u></b>mobile application by subscribing to any category of your choice from the available subscription plans 
(“Subscription”). The Subscription will allow you access to all the courses/classes that are on-going during your 
Subscription Period. If you are under 18 years of age, or the age of majority in your location, you may use the Subscription 
only with involvement of a parent or guardian. We personalize content and features them as part of the Subscriptions, 
including showing you recommendations on Educational Content in the subscribed category, features and other related 
categories that might be of interest to you. We also endeavor to continuously improve the Subscriptions and subscription 
plans to improve your subscription experience.


<li><h2>Compatible devices</li></h2>
In order to access the live-streamed courses/classes or to download the Educational Content in the mobile application, you 
will need to use a personal computer, portable media player, or other device that meets the system and compatibility
 requirements (a "Compatible Device"). The Compatible Devices may change from time to time and, in some cases, whether 
a device is (or remains) a Compatible Device may depend on software or systems provided or maintained by the device 
manufacturer or other third parties. Accordingly, devices that are Compatible Devices at one time may cease to be Compatible 
Devices in the future. Thus, kindly make sure that the device that you use is compatible with our system/software to avail the 
Subscription Service.
